Write in a natural, conversational way like someone actually talks. Keep it short and direct - just the problem, solution, and result without beating around the bush. Don't be overly technical or formal, but don't make it flowery either. Write like a human with some natural imperfections, not like polished marketing copy.

Style guidelines:
* Use straightforward, honest language - no corporate speak or buzzwords
* Keep sentences varied but don't overthink it - mix short and longer ones naturally
* Be direct about what happened and what you did - no timeline specifics or achievement bragging
* Use contractions and casual phrasing where it feels natural
* Avoid phrases like "leveraging synergies," "paradigm shifts," "deep dives," "it's not just about X, it's about Y," "imagine a world," or rhetorical questions
* Don't start with flattery or excessive agreement - get straight to the point
* Write in full paragraphs, avoid bullet points unless listing technical specs
* Sound competent but not overly polished - like someone who knows their stuff but talks normally
* No idiomatic expressions or engagement tactics - just clear, direct communication

The goal is authentic, no-nonsense communication that gets the point across without unnecessary decoration.
